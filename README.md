# Zksync safe:- A multisig Wallet
## The problem zksync safe solves
* **Security:** Traditional cryptocurrency wallets typically only require a single
private key to access and transfer funds, which can make them vulnerable
to theft or loss if that key is compromised or lost. zksync safe require
multiple private keys to authorize transactions, which greatly reduces the
risk of unauthorized access or theft.
* **Trust:** zksync safe allow for greater trust between multiple parties who
want to share control over a cryptocurrency wallet. For example, a business
might use a multisig wallet to ensure that no single employee can access or
transfer large amounts of funds without approval from other team
members.
* **Flexibility:** zksync safe can be customized to require a specific number
of signatures or approvals before a transaction can be executed. This allows
for greater flexibility and control over how funds are managed and
transferred.
* **Decentralization:** zksync safe can also be used to support decentralized
decision-making processes, such as in a DAO (decentralized autonomous
organization) where multiple members may need to approve transactions
or proposals before they can be executed.
* **Recovery:** zksync safe can also provide a safety net in case one or more
private keys are lost or compromised. For example, a 2-of-3 zksync safe
can still access funds as long as two out of three private keys are still
available. This reduces the risk of permanent loss of funds due to human
error or technical issues.
